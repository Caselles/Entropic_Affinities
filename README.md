In this directory you can find a Jupyter Notebook with the implementation of Entropic Affinities, following this article : http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v28/vladymyrov13.pdf.

Entropic affinities is a method to automatically tune the bandwith of each data point when creating a sparse graph on a data set, with a kernel-based method. Here, the implementation uses the Gaussian kernel.
